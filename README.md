# Project Title : Java Quiz Project 

## Project Summary : In this project, admin can login with the correct username and password. Also, admin can save multiple MCQs with four options with their answer key in a quiz.json file.  When admin log in successfully, the system will say the admin to add new questions to the question bank. Until admins press 'q' from the keyboard, they can continue adding multiple MCQs. Now it's time to role-play as a student. students also login with the correct username and password. The users.json file stores login credentials for both admin and student. When you login as a student to the system successfully, the system will ask for the quiz, and if yes, then the system will generate 10 random questions from the quiz bank. Once the quiz is finished, the system will show the result and small feedback based on the marks. Finally, when all the processes are done, student can restart the quiz or quit.
